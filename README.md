# 👋 Full-Stack Web Developer and Engineering Manager

Hi, I'm Chris! In twenty-eight years as a web developer, I've done everything from graphics to maintaining servers, but mostly what I do these days is build APIs with TypeScript and Node.js, build front-ends with React and Next.js, then connect the two together. I also manage teams of people doing this. I've been fully remote since 2010 and spent ten of those years freelancing, so I'm extremely versed in contributing to a wide variety of projects remotely and asynchronously. I've recently started adding Developer Relations skills to my portfolio.

## 🌍 Where You At?

After living my entire life in the US, I relocated to Paris in July of 2024. I plan on being here for the forseeable future.

## 🖱️ Current Gig

I've recently joined my sixth startup, [Embeddable](https://embeddable.com), where I'll be working as a Developer Relations Engineer, doing a combo of coding, documentation, and tutorial work while also actively helping other devs get established on the platform. We allow developers to quickly and easily create custom analytics widgets and embed them in their own products. Check it out!

## 🎸 Hobbies 

I write novels (eleven so far, five self-published) and am working with my literary agent to land my first publishing deal. I play guitar and bass (and the drums, but I haven't had a kit in years), and I also sing. I noodle around on Garage Band a bunch but have never really released anything. I also draw, and regularly post my illustrations to [my BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/cwbuecheler.com). I used to write a nightly cocktail blog and still enjoying making high-quality cocktails. I play too many video games. I like to follow the NBA, particularly the Boston Celtics.
