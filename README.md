# 👋 Full-Stack Web Developer and Engineering Manager

Hi, I'm Chris! In twenty-seven years as a web developer, I've done everything from graphics to maintaining servers, but mostly what I do these days is build APIs with TypeScript and Node.js, build front-ends with React and Next.js, then connect the two together. I also manage teams of people doing this. I've been fully remote since 2010 and spent ten of those years freelancing, so I'm extremely versed in contributing to a wide variety of projects remotely and asynchronously.

If you're wondering why my Github graph looks a little sparse, it's because my most recent job uses a self-hosted version control solution, so none of my work for the past two years shows up here. 😄

## ❗The Big News

In July, 2024, I relocated to Paris (well, Saint-Cloud) full-time. I've spent more than a year of my life in France, including a six-month stint in Paris in 2016, and I'm looking forward to this new adventure. It'll also be fun to be closer to my in-laws after almost two decades of having to fly across an ocean to see them.

## 🖱️ Current Gig

Until I moved, I managed a team of five web developers ranging from juniors to seniors for College of the Holy Cross. I am currently **looking for new opportunities**.

## 🎸 Hobbies 

I write novels (eleven so far, five self-published) and am working with my literary agent to land my first publishing deal. I play guitar and bass (and the drums, but I haven't had a kit in years), and I also sing. I noodle around on Garage Band a bunch but have never really released anything. I also draw, and regularly post my illustrations to [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cwbuecheler). I used to write a nightly cocktail blog and still enjoying making high-quality cocktails. I play too many video games. I like to follow the NBA, particularly the Boston Celtics.
